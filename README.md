# ng-music-chat

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.0.3.

## Motive

The goal which I am trying to reach is to practice and to work on my craft. Herefore I created this Project 'ng-music-chat' with the Backend Project 'music-chat' written in Python/FastAPI in which I combined multiple smaller use cases. in which the following points can be done:

  - Sign up & Sign in (Authentication)
  - Upload Files (Profile photo & music)
  - Receiving, displaying and run files (Profile photo, receiving and playing music)
  - Music Player Component - play single or list of songs (to play music)
  - List users, request new contacts & accept requests

## How to proceed?

I am currently really motivated to working on my craft and to excel. For now I will prioritize functionality over UX/UI, therefore do not be to disappointed as soon you will see the UI :D

After I got the feeling, that the application has reach a decent level of maturity and functionality I will work on the UI, to please potential users. Thereafter I plan to implement the backend again in Go (Golang). Both Languages, Python & Go, are really powerful and I really like touse them ^^
